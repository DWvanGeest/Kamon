Reporting Metrics to Datadog
===========================

[Datadog] is a monitoring service for IT, Operations and Development teams who write and run applications at scale, and
want to turn the massive amounts of data produced by their apps, tools and services into actionable insight.

### Getting Started

Supported releases and dependencies are shown below.

| kamon-datadog  | status | jdk  | scala            |
|:--------------:|:------:|:----:|------------------|
|  1.0.0         | stable | 1.8+ | 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 |

To get started with SBT, simply add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.kamon" %% "kamon-datadog" % "1.0.0"
```

And add the Agent or API reporter to Kamon:

```
Kamon.addReporter(new DatadogAgentReporter())
// OR
Kamon.addReporter(new DatadogAPIReporter())
```

In order to get [APM tracing](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/) working, add

```
Kamon.addReporter(new DatadogSpanReporter())
```

Configuration
-------------

#### Agent Reporter

By default, the Agent reporter assumes that you have an instance of the Datadog Agent running in localhost and listening on
port 8125. If that is not the case, you can use the `kamon.datadog.agent.hostname` and `kamon.datadog.agent.port` configuration
keys to point the module at your Datadog Agent installation.

#### API Reporter

When using the API reporter you must configure your API key using the `kamon.datadog.http.api-key` configuration setting.
Since Kamon has access to the entire distribution of values for a given period, the API reporter can directly post the
data that would otherwise be summarized and sent by the Datadog Agent. Gauges andAll histogram-backed metrics will be reported as
follows:
  - metric.avg
  - metric.count
  - metric.median
  - metric.95percentile
  - metric.max
  - metric.min

You can refer to the [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/metrics/#histograms) for more details.


#### Span Reporter
As [recommended](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=python#tracing) , the Span reporter assumes that you have an instance of the Datadog Agent running in localhost and listening on
port 8125. If that is not the case, you can use the `kamon.datadog.trace.http.api-url` configuration
key to point the module at your Datadog Agent installation.

Don't forget to configure [actors filtering for message tracing](https://kamon.io/docs/latest/instrumentation/akka/tracing/) 


### Metric Units ###

Kamon keeps all timing measurements in nanoseconds and memory measurements in bytes. In order to scale those to other
units before sending to datadog set the `time-units` and `memory-units` config keys to desired units. Supported units are:

```
n  - nanoseconds
Âµs - microseconds
ms - milliseconds
s  - seconds

b  - bytes
kb - kilobytes
mb - megabytes
gb - gigabytes
```

For example,

```
kamon.datadog.time-units = "ms" 
```

will scale all timing measurements to milliseconds right before sending to datadog.


Integration Notes
-----------------

* Contrary to other Datadog client implementations, we don't flush the metrics data as soon as the measurements are
  taken but instead, all metrics data is buffered by the `kamon-datadog` module and flushed periodically using the
  configured `kamon.metric.tick-interval` and `kamon.datadog.max-packet-size` settings.
* It is advisable to experiment with the `kamon.metric.tick-interval` and `kamon.datadog.agent.max-packet-size` settings to
  find the right balance between network bandwidth utilisation and granularity on your metrics data.


Visualization and Fun
---------------------

Creating a dashboard in the Datadog user interface is really simple, all metric names will match the Kamon metric names
with the additional "qualifier" suffix. Here is a very simple example of a dashboard created with metrics reported by Kamon:
