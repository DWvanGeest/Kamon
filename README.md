Kamon is a set of tools for monitoring applications running on the JVM.

### Getting Started

Kamon is currently available for Scala 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12.

Supported releases and dependencies are shown below.

| kamon  | status | jdk  | scala            
|:------:|:------:|:----:|------------------
|  1.0.0 | stable | 1.7+, 1.8+ | 2.10, 2.11, 2.12

To get started with SBT, simply add the following to your `build.sbt` or `pom.xml`
file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.kamon" %% "kamon-core" % "1.0.0"
```

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.kamon</groupId>
    <artifactId>kamon-core_2.12</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Documentation

Kamon information and documentation is available on the
[website](http://kamon.io).

### Modules ###

We started migrating modules to Kamon `1.0.0` based on the usage data we have, community demand and time availability, but
not all have been upgraded just yet. 

Now, the lucky modules currently available are:
  - [Core](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon) includes all metrics, tracing and context management APIs.
  - [Akka](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-akka) for actor metrics and tracing inside a single JVM.
  - [Akka Remote](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-akka-remote) has now serialization and remoting metrics and is able
    to trace messages across remote actor systems.
  - [Akka HTTP](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-akka-http) with client and service side tracing and HTTP server metrics.
  - [Futures](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-futures) bring automatic context propagation for Scala, Finagle and
    Scalaz futures.
  - [Executors](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-executors) collects executor service metrics.
  - [Play Framework](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-futures) with client and server side tracing.
  - [JDBC](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-jdbc) gives you metrics and tracing for JDBC statements execution and
    Hikari pool metrics.
  - [Logback](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-logback) comes with utilities for adding trace IDs to your logs and
    instrumentation to keep context when using async appenders.
  - [System Metrics](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-system-metrics) gathers host, process and JVM metrics.

### Backends ###

  - [Promethus](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-prometheus) exposes a scrape endpoint with all available metrics.
  - [Zipkin](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-zipkin) for reporting trace data.
  - [Jaeger](https://github.com/kamon-io/kamon-jaeger) reports tracing data as well.
  - [Kamino](https://github.com/kamino-apm/kamino-reporter) reports metrics and tracing data to [Kamino][8]
