/**
 *  This recorder keeps track of the last value recoded and automatically adds it after collecting a snapshot. This is
 *  useful in cases where the absence of recordings does not necessarily mean the absence of values. For example, if this
 *  recorder is used for recording the mailbox size of an actor, and it only gets updated upon message enqueue o dequeue,
 *  the absence of recordings during 1 second means that the size hasn't change (example: the actor being blocked doing
 *  some work) and it should keep its last known value, instead of dropping to zero and then going back to the real value
 *  after a new event is processed.
