/**
  * An immutable set of information that is tied to the processing of single operation in a service. A Context instance
  * can contain tags and entries.
  *
  * Context tags are built on top of the TagSet abstraction that ships with Kamon and since Kamon knows exactly what
  * types of values can be included in a TagSet it can automatically  serialize and deserialize them when going over
  * HTTP and/or Binary transports.
  *
  * Context entries can contain any arbitrary type specified by the user, but require additional configuration and
  * implementation of entry readers and writers if you need them to go over HTTP and/or Binary transports.
  *
  * Context instances are meant to be constructed by using the builder functions on the Context companion object.
